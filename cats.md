### food & water

- food is on the top shelf in the closet in the living room
- in the morning, give each cat 1/4 cup of dry food (25 g)
- in the evening, give each cat 1/4 cup of dry food and split a 3 oz can of wet food between them
- clean the bowls every other day or so
- if the water fountain is running low, pour some more water in it

### litter

- the litter box will scoop itself, but needs to be emptied every 3-4 days. the light at the top of the litter box will be flashing blue if it needs to be emptied.

- to empty the box, open the drawer by pulling at the step at the base. remove the trash bag, tie it up, and throw it in the kitchen trash can. add a new trash bag (from below the kitchen sink) and push it flat against the drawer, then close the drawer. press the middle button on the control panel (looks like a circle with a x in the middle)

- otherwise, the light on the litter box shows the status of the box
  - solid blue → nothing needs to be done
  - solid red → the litter box is waiting to cycle. you can just ignore it.
  - any other color → idk what's up but the [manual](https://www.litter-robot.com/manual_pdf/Litter-Robot-4-Manual.pdf) will say (page 20)

### toys

- the cats love to play!
- bean loves foam soccer balls and the squishy mouse toy. these toys might be stuck under the fridge
- snorkel loves the rattle mouses
- if snorkel shows you her cute tummy, don't fall for it. it's a trap

### in case of emergency

- two cat carriers will be out in the living room
- the cats' vet is [greenpoint veterinary care](https://goo.gl/maps/9QbmTKHxHafeJHdNA) (about an 8 minute walk away on mcguinness blvd)
- if their vet is closed, the nearby [veterinary emergency group](https://goo.gl/maps/eQiZ7Dq9AaTDyg6Z7) is open 24/7 (a 11 minute walk on kent)
