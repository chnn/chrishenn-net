title: Rewrites

There's a [well-known article](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) that argues one should never rewrite a software project.
I have always struggled to respect this approach, because I really _like_ rewriting projectsâ€”or at least substantial portions of them.

My preferences are driven by my belief in a few complementary axioms:

1. Writing code is easy
2. Modifying code is hard
3. Incidental complexity is rampant
4. Necessary complexity is rare

I don't think these beliefs would make sense in a high quality codebase.
But I'm not convinced such a codebase exists :)
