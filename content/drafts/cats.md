### food & water

- food is in the cabinet above the fridge
- in the morning, give each cat 30 g of dry food (about 1/4 cup)
- in the evening, give each cat:
  - a 3 oz can of wet food 
  - with 1/4 tsp of psyllium husk mixed in
  - and in snorkel's bowl, also mix in one packet of FortiFlora probiotics
- clean the bowls every other day or so
- if the water fountain is running low, pour some more water in it

### litter

- scoop the litter box once in the morning and once at night
- dispose of waste into the top of the black pail next to the litter box
- when done scooping, pull the handle in the middle of the pail to drop the waste below and seal the odors ([video](https://youtu.be/3bX2z3qsyjQ?t=36))

### toys

- the cats love to play!
- bean loves foam soccer balls and the squishy mouse toy. these toys might be stuck under the couch
- snorkel loves the rattle mouses
- if snorkel shows you her cute tummy, don't fall for it. it's a trap

### if they do something gross

i.e. if the cats vom or poo where they shouldn't:

- yuck! sorry you have to deal with it. this rarely happens but isn't entirely unexpected
- there are nitrile disposable gloves, paper towels, and some enzymatic cleaners ("nature's miracle") under the kitchen sink

### in case of emergency

- two cat carriers will be out in the living room
- the cats' vet is [greenpoint veterinary care](https://goo.gl/maps/9QbmTKHxHafeJHdNA) (3 blocks away)
- if their vet is closed, the nearby [veterinary emergency group](https://goo.gl/maps/eQiZ7Dq9AaTDyg6Z7) is open 24/7 (0.9 mi away on kent)
