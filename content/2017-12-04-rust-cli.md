title: Hacking together a CLI with Rust
---

I'm supposed to be writing a mathematics thesis at Reed at the moment, which involves the minor tedium of collecting citation data into BibTeX. Naturally, this seemed like a great opportunity to halt all important work and start a little side project :)

I hacked together [a tool](https://github.com/chnn/mathbib) to assist collecting BibTeX citations. The program is quite simple, but was fun to build as a first project in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). A few notes about the Rust learning experience:

- Rust has an incredible package ecosystem, largely enabled by Cargo. After reading the first few chapters of [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), it was easy to wire up some plumbing between [various crates](https://github.com/chnn/mathbib/blob/6abbc95848b5a80b932eb4e6a74f3f6fa8eaa43a/Cargo.toml#L7-L13) to get a working prototype very rapidly. For example, I use the [scraper](https://crates.io/crates/scraper) crate to scrape publication data from [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/). The scraper package uses [Servo](https://servo.org/) under the hood, which unlocks browser-grade parsing and querying with very little effort!

- The Rust compiler is infamously fickle. While I did receive lots of bewildering feedback from the compiler along the way, I found this to be a nice feedback loop around which to organize my development workflow. The feedback loop felt similar to TDD.

- I was pleasantly surprised to find how ergonomic and comprehensive error handling is in Rustâ€”this is perhaps my favorite aspect of the language so far. It's kinda like error handling in Go, except it feels less ad-hoc.

I plan to work on this project a little more. I want to make the code more idiomatic, and perhaps make the tool pluggable next for multiple citation databases.
